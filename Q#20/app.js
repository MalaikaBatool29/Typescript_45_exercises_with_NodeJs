//Q#20: Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var mountains = ["Mount Everest", "Godwin Austin", "Nanga Parbat", "Gasherbrum", "Rakaposhi"
];
for (var _i = 0, mountains_1 = mountains; _i < mountains_1.length; _i++) {
    var mountain = mountains_1[_i];
    console.log(mountain);
}
