//Q#20: Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let mountains:string[] = ["Mount Everest","Godwin Austin", "Nanga Parbat","Gasherbrum", "Rakaposhi"
];

for (let mountain of mountains) {
    console.log(mountain);
    
}
