//Q#14: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

const groups:string[] = ["Hania", "Hadia", "Hafsa"];

for (const group of groups) {
    console.log(`Hi ${group}! I would like to invite you to dinner at my place this Saturday at 7 pm. `);
    
}
